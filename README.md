## Overview

This is a repository containing useful small scripts related to Unity development. The main purpose of those scripts is my own use but the issues and PR are open to anyone.

## Documentation

Each tool has his own documentation either in a Documentation folder or, if it's a script / executable, by executing that tool with `-- help`.

## Tools list

* Unity Package Generator: python script handling basic folders and files creation for a custom package.
